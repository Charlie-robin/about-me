                <h1>Hi!</h1>
                My name is Eyrim, I'm a software engineer from England.

                I tend to focus more on backend development, though I'm able to work full stack when required (just
                badly :p). I have
                recently developed a particular interest in lower level programming. Though my main experience is in
                Java
                and C#.
                <br />
                <br />
                My current favourite languages are Golang and C. Golang because of how quick it is to work with and the
                fact
                it still provides you with some lower level control, without abstracting too much away (looking at you
                Java). C is fun because of how many "ohhhhh that's why we do it like that" moments I have when learning
                about it.

                    This was a school project where I had to complete a project that covered enough different things to
                    get a good mark. So I chose a full stack web application using ASP.NET MVC with C#, I bit off way
                    more than I could chew at the time and so didn't have much time to properly design it (or fix design
                    shortcomings). It uses a grid of cells and images of both IEC and US electrical components. The user
                    picks the component they want to place and clicks on grid squares. The app supports saving files
                    locally in JSON format and then loading them in again.

                    I use Neovim as my main editor, which is famous for having poor Java support. At work we use both
                    Java and the Cucumber testing framework which uses a language called Gherkin. TreeSitter is a tool
                    for building Concrete Syntax Trees from an arbitrary source code input, providing there is a parser
                    available. I am working on writing a grammar for the Gherkin language as a way of contributing to
                    improving Neovim's support for different languages. I also want a parser as I have a project idea
                    which will require a parser to be available for Gherkin.

            <h2>Well Designed Sites</h2>

            <section id="good-websites">
                <h3 class="website-link">
                    <a href="https://nixos.org/" target="_blank">NixOS:</a>
                </h3>
                <aside class="good-website-description">
                    One of the reasons I like this website is due to how rare it is for this style of Linux distro
                    to have such a good looking and usable website. It's easy to find everything you may want to do
                    and find out initially, and its clear how it could be useful for returning users looking for
                    documentation/support etc.

                    As a comparison, the <a href="" target="_blank">Arch Linux Website</a> is, in my opinion, pretty
                    bad. NixOS is quite a niche distribution which will largely only be used by Linux enthusiasts,
                    similar to Arch. However, unlike Arch, the website has been designed to have a really good UX
                    and be welcoming to the distro.
                </aside>
                <h3 class="website-link">
                    <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank">Rust Lang:</a>
                </h3>
                <aside class="good-website-description">
                    The rust-lang website is very well designed, it is clearly laid out, with the most likely things
                    the user is looking for further up, and less used things such as maintainership and NPM funding
                    further down. The download page is very refreshing, I setup linux quite often and rust is always
                    one of the first things I install, having platform-agnostic install methods presented to the
                    user immediately on the page is a big benefit.

                    I also like how simple the website is, navigating it with purely the keyboard is quite easy. The
                    site doesn't necessitate any specialised accessibilty methods due to how simple it is. Making
                    the site better for able-bodied users as well as disabled users.
