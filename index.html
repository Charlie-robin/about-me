            <h1>Hi!</h1>
            My name is Eyrim, I'm a software engineer from England.

            I tend to focus more on backend development, though I'm able to work full stack when required. I have
            recently developed a particular interest in lower level programming. Though my main experience is in Java
            and C#.
            <br />
            <br />
            My current favourite languages are Golang and C. Golang because of how quick it is to work with and the fact
            it still provides you with some lower level control, without abstracting too much away (looking at you
            Java). C is fun because of how many "ohhhhh that's why we do it like that" moments I have when learning
            about it.

                <aside class="project-description">
                    This was a school project where I had to complete a project that covered enough different things to
                    get a good mark. So I chose a full stack web application using ASP.NET MVC with C#, I bit off way
                    more than I could chew at the time and so didn't have much time to properly design it (or fix design
                    shortcomings). It uses a grid of cells and images of both IEC and US electrical components. The user
                    picks the component they want to place and clicks on grid squares. The app supports saving files
                    locally in JSON format and then loading them in again.

                <a href="https://github.com/Eyrim/tree-sitter-gherkin">A TreeSitter parser for the Gherkin language used
                    in system testing</a>
                <aside class="project-description">
                    I use Neovim as my main editor, which is famous for having poor Java support. At work we use both
                    Java and the Cucumber testing framework which uses a language called Gherkin. TreeSitter is a tool
                    for building Concrete Syntax Trees from an arbitrary source code input, providing there is a parser
                    available. I am working on writing a grammar for the Gherkin language as a way of contributing to
                    improving Neovim's support for different languages. I also want a parser as I have a project idea
                    which will require a parser to be available for Gherkin.
