            <h2>
                What is a Null Pointer?
            </h2>
            <section>
                In my recent travels into the land of C and low level programming. I came across <code>NULL</code> in C.
                In C, NULL is simply a pointer to memory address <code>0x000000</code>, which is reserved by the
                Operating System. Hence throwing an error. I would assume C catches this error itself as an attempt to
                access forbidden memory would typically cause a program to be killed by the host OS. I just find it
                interesting that in some languages these etherial ever-looming concepts become extremly tangible.

            <h2>
                Why do we end lines in semicolons?
            </h2>
            <section>
                I've not been able to find very much evidence for this, but I've been playing around with a bit of x86
                assembly lately (for understanding, not real projects), and seeing some of my code look like this:
                <p>
                    <code>
                        mv aa, 0x005000 <span class="assembly-comment">; move a value into something</span><br />
                        cmp aa, 0x000000 <span class="assembly-comment">; compare aa against someting</span><br />
                        lt myLabel <span class="assembly-comment">; go to another subroutine</span><br />
                    </code>
                </p>

                This is a common pattern in assembly, semicolons are used for comments, and most lines end in these
                comments due to the nature of the language. My theory is that this naturally translated into
                higher-level languages, as the creators of most modern high-level language will have gotten their start
                in the realm of low-level.
